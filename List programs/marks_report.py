## Assume that the marks of 10 students are available in a tuple. The marks are out of 25.
##
## Write a python program to implement the following functions:
##    
## 1.  find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored more than the average mark of the class.
##
## 2.  generate_frequency(): Find how many students have scored the same marks. For example, how many have scored 0, how many have scored 1,
##            how many have scored 3â€¦.how many have scored 25. The result should be populated in a list and returned.
##            
## 3.  sort_marks(): Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a list and returned
